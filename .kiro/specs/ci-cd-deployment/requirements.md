# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for implementing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the VixSeg corporate website. The system will automate the build, test, and deployment process using both GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions, with the application running on a production server managed by PM2.

## Glossary

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: An automated workflow that builds, tests, and deploys code changes
- **GitLab CI/CD**: GitLab's built-in continuous integration and deployment service
- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub's automation platform for CI/CD workflows
- **PM2**: A production process manager for Node.js applications
- **SSH**: Secure Shell protocol for secure remote server access
- **Build Artifact**: The compiled output of the Next.js application ready for deployment
- **Deployment Server**: The production server (vixseg.com.br) where the application runs
- **Workflow**: An automated process defined in YAML configuration files

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated builds to run on every code push, so that I can catch errors early before they reach production

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes code to any branch, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL execute a build process
2. WHEN the build process executes, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL install all dependencies from package.json
3. WHEN dependencies are installed, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL run the Next.js build command
4. IF the build fails, THEN THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL report the failure status and prevent deployment
5. WHEN the build succeeds, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL create Build Artifacts for deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code quality checks to run automatically, so that code standards are maintained across the project

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL execute ESLint validation
2. IF linting errors are detected, THEN THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL report the errors and fail the workflow
3. WHEN linting passes, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL proceed to the next workflow stage
4. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL use the project's existing ESLint configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic deployment to production when code is merged to the main branch, so that new features reach users quickly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to the main branch, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL trigger the deployment workflow
2. WHEN the deployment workflow triggers, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL connect to the Deployment Server via SSH
3. WHEN connected to the server, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL transfer Build Artifacts to the server
4. WHEN artifacts are transferred, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL execute PM2 commands to restart the application
5. IF deployment fails at any step, THEN THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL report the failure and maintain the previous version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want secure credential management, so that sensitive server information is not exposed in the codebase

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL store SSH credentials as encrypted environment variables
2. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL store server host, port, and user information as environment variables
3. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL NOT include any credentials in workflow configuration files
4. WHEN accessing credentials, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL use the platform's secret management system
5. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL use SSH key-based authentication instead of password authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the same CI/CD workflow to work on both GitLab and GitHub, so that the project can be hosted on either platform

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL provide equivalent functionality on both GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions
2. WHEN configured on GitLab, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL use .gitlab-ci.yml configuration
3. WHEN configured on GitHub, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL use .github/workflows configuration
4. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL execute the same build, test, and deployment steps on both platforms
5. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL use platform-specific syntax while maintaining functional equivalence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want PM2 to manage the application process, so that the application automatically restarts on failures and runs reliably

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed, THE Deployment Server SHALL run the application using PM2
2. THE Deployment Server SHALL configure PM2 to run the application on port 3105
3. WHEN PM2 starts the application, THE Deployment Server SHALL name the process "vixseg-site"
4. IF the application crashes, THEN THE Deployment Server SHALL automatically restart it via PM2
5. THE Deployment Server SHALL persist PM2 configuration to survive server reboots

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployment status notifications, so that I know immediately if a deployment succeeds or fails

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment completes successfully, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL report success status
2. WHEN a deployment fails, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL report failure status with error details
3. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL display deployment status in the repository's CI/CD interface
4. WHEN viewing workflow history, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL show timestamps and duration for each deployment
5. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL provide logs for troubleshooting failed deployments

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want controlled deployment with manual approval, so that accidental or unauthorized deployments are prevented

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL require manual approval before executing deployment to production
2. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL run build and test steps automatically
3. WHEN build and tests pass, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL wait for manual deployment trigger
4. WHERE a git tag matching pattern "v*.*.\*" is pushed, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL enable deployment workflow
5. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL provide a manual "Deploy" button in the workflow interface

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to skip CI/CD execution for documentation changes, so that pipeline resources are not wasted on non-code changes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commit message contains "[ci skip]", THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL not execute any workflow
2. WHEN a commit message contains "[skip ci]", THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL not execute any workflow
3. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL check commit messages before starting any jobs
4. WHEN CI is skipped, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL report the skip status in the repository interface
5. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL document the skip keywords in workflow configuration comments

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want deployment restricted to authorized personnel, so that only approved team members can deploy to production

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL restrict manual deployment triggers to repository maintainers only
2. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL log which user initiated each deployment
3. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts deployment, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL deny the action
4. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL display required permissions in workflow documentation
5. WHERE deployment is triggered, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL record the trigger source in deployment logs
